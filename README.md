# FreeGamesTracker
A simple JavaFX application that fetches an API and displays information about some free games. The application GUI is made to resemble a game launcher, but for obvious reasons you can't launch games from this program as it's supposed to be a simple showcase. I also made sure that the program is resizable and responsive.
Keep in mind the program may or may not work based on the availability of the API.
